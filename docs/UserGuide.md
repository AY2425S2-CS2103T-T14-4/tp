AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items in curly brackets `{}` separated by `|` are mutually exclusive.<br>
  e.g. `{n/NAME | t/TAG}` can be used as `n/John Doe` or as `t/customer`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating your contacts in the network: `find`

Finds contacts by matching name and tag keywords you provide.

Format: `find {n/NAME_KEYWORD [NAME_KEYWORD]... [t/TAG_KEYWORD [TAG_KEYWORD]...] | t/TAG_KEYWORD [TAG_KEYWORD]... [n/NAME_KEYWORD [NAME_KEYWORD]...]}`

* `NAME_KEYWORD` is a word without spaces to search only name. e.g. In `n/Hans Bo` both `Hans` and `Bo` are keywords
* `TAG_KEYWORD` is a word without spaces to search only tags. e.g. In `n/downline customer` both `downline` and `customer` are keywords
* Supply at least one of `n/NAME_KEYWORD` or `t/TAG_KEYWORD`.
* Searching ignores case for both names and tags. e.g `n/hans` matches `Hans` name, `t/customer` matches `Customer` tag
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `n/Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans` name, `t/downline customer` matches `customer` and `downline` tags
* Matches only full words e.g. `n/Han` does not match `Hans` name, `t/downlines` does not match `downline` tag
* When providing only `NAME_KEYWORD`, the command finds persons whose name contain at least one keyword (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. Providing `n/Hans Bo` finds `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* When providing only `TAG_KEYWORD`, the command finds persons whose tags contain at least one keyword (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. Providing `t/downline customer` finds person with tags `downline` and `family`, as well as person with tags `customer` and `friend`
* When providing both `NAME_KEYWORD` and `TAG_KEYWORD`, the command finds persons with name matching at least one name keyword and tags matching at least one tag keyword will be returned (i.e. `AND` search between name and tags). e.g. Providing `n/Hans Bo t/downline customer` finds `Hans Gruber` and with tags `downline` and `family`, but not `Bo Yang` with tags `family` and `friend`

Examples:
* `find n/John` finds `john` and `John Doe`
* `find n/alex david t/downline customer` finds `Alex Yeoh` with tag `downline`, `David Li` with tag `customer`<br>
  ![result for 'find n/alex david t/downline customer'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Including your contacts by name to specific group: `incl`

Adding people with matching name from your contacts to the list.

Format: `incl n/NAME_KEYWORD`

* `NAME_KEYWORD` is same as defined above.
* Searching ignores case for the name. e.g `n/hans` matches `Hans` name
* Matches only full words e.g. `n/Han` does not match `Hans` name
Examples:
* `find n/John` finds `john` and `John Doe`
### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
